Feature: Express integers in words
  Take a number as an input and print out the equivalent number in British English words
  without using a tokenizer, or any external libraries, clever regexâ€™s or the like.

  Scenario Outline: Example numbers in words                                      # features/integers_to_words.feature:5
    Given an integer number "<number>" its expresion in words should be "<words>" # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:3
